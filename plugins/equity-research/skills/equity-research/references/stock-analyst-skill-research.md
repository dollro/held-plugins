# Professional Stock Investment Analyst Skill for Claude
## Research Report: Architecture, Tools & MCP Server Ecosystem

---

## Executive Summary

Building a professional-grade stock chance/risk analysis skill for Claude requires combining three layers: **(1)** a well-structured SKILL.md with analyst frameworks, **(2)** real-time financial data via MCP servers, and **(3)** web search + document creation capabilities for the final report output. The research below maps the full landscape and recommends an optimal architecture.

## 1. MCP Server Landscape for Financial Data

### Tier 1: Best-in-Class (Recommended Stack)

| MCP Server | Data Coverage | API Key? | Best For |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Octagon MCP** (`octagon-mcp`) | SEC filings (8K+ companies), 10yr earnings transcripts, financial metrics/ratios, stock data (10K+ tickers), 13F holdings, private markets | Yes (free tier) | **All-in-one investment research** — orchestrates multiple specialized agents |
| **SEC EDGAR MCP** (`sec-edgar-mcp`) | 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, XBRL financials, insider trading (Form 4), company facts | No (free SEC API) | **Primary source financials** — exact numeric precision from XBRL |
| **Yahoo Finance MCP** (`mcp-yahoo-finance`) | Real-time prices, historical data, company info, financial statements, options, earnings, news | No (no auth) | **Quick market data** — zero setup, ideal for price/valuation snapshot |

### Tier 2: Complementary / Specialized

| MCP Server | Data Coverage | API Key? | Best For |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Alpha Vantage MCP** | Stocks, options, forex, crypto, commodities, 50+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, Bollinger) | Yes (free tier) | **Technical analysis** — richest indicator library |
| **Financial Datasets MCP** | Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, stock prices, market news | Yes | **Clean fundamental data** with millisecond latency |
| **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)** | Fundamentals, DCF valuations, ratios, ETF composition, peer comparisons | Yes | **Valuation models** — includes DCF and comps data |
| **Finnhub MCP** | Market news, stock quotes, financials, analyst recommendations, earnings surprises | Yes (free tier) | **Sentiment & analyst consensus** |

### Tier 3: Specialized Add-ons

| MCP Server | Use Case |
|-|-|
| **Alpaca MCP** | Paper trading, position tracking, brokerage-grade real-time data |
| **Bright Data Yahoo Finance** | Enterprise-grade scraping with CAPTCHA bypass (paid) |
| **EdgarTools (Python lib)** | AI-native SEC analysis with MCP server built-in, 3,450+ lines of API docs |

### Recommendation for Your Skill

**Primary stack:** Octagon MCP + Yahoo Finance MCP + Claude's built-in web search

- **Octagon** handles the heavy lifting: SEC filings, earnings transcripts, financial metrics, institutional holdings, and deep research — all via a single MCP endpoint
- **Yahoo Finance** provides the real-time price snapshot, historical prices, and quick fundamental data without any API key
- **Web search** fills gaps: analyst price targets, recent news sentiment, macro context, competitor developments

**Why not SEC EDGAR directly?** Octagon already wraps SEC EDGAR data with additional intelligence layers. Only add raw SEC EDGAR MCP if you need exact XBRL-parsed numbers for financial modeling.

**Why not Alpha Vantage?** Add it only if the skill needs deep technical analysis (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands). For a fundamental chance/risk report, it's optional.

## 4. MCP Server Configuration

For Claude Desktop / Claude Code, the config would look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octagon": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "octagon-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OCTAGON_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY"
      }
    },
    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-yahoo-finance"]
    },
    "sec-edgar": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm", "-e",
        "SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=Your Name (email@example.com)",
        "stefanoamorelli/sec-edgar-mcp:latest"
      ]
    },
    "alpha-vantage": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-alphavantage"],
      "env": {
        "ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For **Claude.ai** (consumer interface, your current environment):
- Use the **Anthropic API within artifacts** to call MCP servers via the inner API
- Use **web search** as the primary data source (already available)
- Use **web_fetch** to pull data from Yahoo Finance, Finviz, SEC EDGAR directly
- Build the analysis using Claude's built-in reasoning + structured frameworks from the skill

---

## 5. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Skill (works in claude.ai today)
Build the SKILL.md with full analyst frameworks, scoring rubrics, and report template. Use web search + web_fetch as primary data sources. This gives you 80% of the value immediately.

**Data sources via web search/fetch:**
- Yahoo Finance pages → price, fundamentals, financial statements
- SEC EDGAR full-text search → 10-K, 10-Q filings
- Finviz → screening data, analyst targets, technical snapshot
- Macrotrends.net → historical financials
- Seeking Alpha / analyst coverage → consensus estimates

### Phase 2: MCP Integration (Claude Desktop / Claude Code)
Add Octagon MCP + Yahoo Finance MCP for structured data retrieval. This upgrades data quality from "web-scraped" to "API-grade."

### Phase 3: Output Polish
Integrate with docx/pdf/pptx skills for professional output formatting. Generate downloadable reports with charts and tables.

### Phase 4: Artifact Mode
Build a React artifact that displays the analysis interactively — with tabs for each section, expandable risk matrices, and an IAS radar chart.
