## 1. Risk Category Framework

### Category A: Business & Competitive Risk

| Risk | Description | What to Look For | Severity If Realized |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Moat Erosion** | Competitive advantages weakening | Market share loss, pricing pressure, margin compression, new well-funded entrants | High — structural value destruction |
| **Disruption** | Technology or business model substitution | Emerging alternatives gaining traction, customer migration signals, declining NPS | Very High — potential existential |
| **Customer Concentration** | Revenue dependence on few customers | Top customer > 10% revenue, contract renewal dates, customer financial health | High — revenue cliff risk |
| **Product Concentration** | Revenue dependence on single product | Single product > 60% revenue, product lifecycle stage, replacement pipeline | Medium to High |
| **Pricing Power Loss** | Inability to maintain/raise prices | Gross margin erosion in inflationary environment, customer pushback, competitive undercutting | High — permanent margin reset |
| **Management Execution** | Failure to deliver on strategy | Guidance misses, delayed product launches, failed integration, leadership turnover | Medium — recoverable if addressed |

### Category B: Financial Risk

| Risk | Description | What to Look For | Severity If Realized |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Leverage / Debt** | Excessive debt burden | Net debt/EBITDA > sector "Weak" threshold, covenant proximity, rising interest expense, ratings downgrade | Very High — solvency risk |
| **Liquidity** | Insufficient cash to meet obligations | Declining cash balances, negative operating CF, maturity wall, revolver draw | Very High — immediate |
| **Earnings Quality** | Reported earnings overstating reality | GAAP/non-GAAP divergence growing, accruals rising, FCF conversion declining, DSO increasing | High — trust destruction |

## 2. Early Warning Indicators

These are leading indicators that often precede material fundamental deterioration. Screen for these in every analysis.

### Financial Early Warnings

| Indicator | Signal | Data Source | Action Level |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Revenue deceleration** | Sequential QoQ growth rate declining for 3+ quarters | Quarterly income statement | Review thesis if growth halves |
| **Gross margin erosion** | Gross margin down > 100 bps YoY for 2+ quarters | Quarterly income statement | Investigate cause immediately |

| **DSO increase** | Days sales outstanding rising > 10% YoY | Balance sheet + revenue | Revenue quality concern |
| **Inventory build** | Inventory growth > revenue growth for 2+ quarters | Balance sheet | Demand weakness or obsolescence |
| **Debt increase** | Net debt/EBITDA deteriorating by > 0.5x in 12 months | Balance sheet | Monitor covenant headroom |

## 3. Stress Test Scenarios

Apply these standardized stress tests to assess downside resilience.

### Scenario 1: Mild Recession (-10% Revenue)
**Assumptions:** Revenue declines 10% from current level. Gross margins compress 200 bps. Operating expenses stay flat (limited variable cost flex). Working capital deteriorates slightly.

**Calculate:**
- Stressed EBITDA = Revenue × 0.90 × (Current margin − 2pp)
- Stressed interest coverage = Stressed EBITDA / Interest expense
- Can the company still service debt? Cover dividend? Maintain investment?
- How many quarters of cash runway at stressed burn rate?

### Scenario 2: Severe Recession (-25% Revenue)
**Assumptions:** Revenue declines 25%. Gross margins compress 500 bps. Company cuts opex by 15% (with lag). Working capital deteriorates meaningfully.

**Calculate:**
- Same as above but more severe
- At what point do covenants trigger?
- Does the company need to raise capital at distressed terms?
- Is the equity value impaired in this scenario?

### Scenario 3: Competitive Disruption (-15% Revenue, Permanent)
**Assumptions:** A competitor captures 15% of the company's revenue permanently. No margin offset possible. Growth rate permanently reduced by 5pp.

**Calculate:**
- Impact on intrinsic value (DCF with permanently lower growth)
- Fair value under disrupted growth scenario vs. current price
- What valuation multiple does the market currently embed? Is it too optimistic?

### Scenario 4: Interest Rate Shock (+200 bps)
**Assumptions:** Interest rates rise 200 bps across the curve. All variable-rate debt reprices immediately. Fixed-rate debt reprices at maturity.

**Calculate:**
- Incremental annual interest expense
- Impact on EPS
- WACC increases → DCF fair value impact
- P/E compression for long-duration assets

### Scenario 5: Regulatory Disruption
**Assumptions:** Adverse regulation implemented. Revenue from affected segment declines 30% over 3 years. Compliance costs increase opex by 5%.

**Calculate:**
- Affected revenue as % of total
- EPS impact under regulatory scenario
- Sum-of-parts: value excluding affected segment vs. current EV

## 4. Monitoring Triggers

Define specific thresholds that should trigger a thesis review. Include these in every report.

### Standard Monitoring Framework

| Category | Metric | Positive Trigger (upgrade thesis) | Negative Trigger (downgrade thesis) |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Growth** | Revenue growth QoQ | Acceleration for 2+ quarters | Deceleration for 3+ quarters |
| **Margins** | Operating margin | Expansion > 100 bps sustained | Compression > 150 bps sustained |
| **Cash Flow** | FCF conversion | Sustained > 100% | Drops below 60% |
| **Leverage** | Net debt/EBITDA | Below 1.0x and declining | Above sector "Weak" threshold |
| **Returns** | ROIC | Rising above WACC spread | Falling below WACC |
| **Valuation** | Forward P/E | Moves below 5yr average | Moves above 5yr 90th percentile |
| **Competition** | Market share | Evidence of sustained share gains | Evidence of share loss |
| **Management** | Insider activity | Meaningful open-market buying | Cluster selling outside 10b5-1 |
| **Governance** | Board changes | New independent directors with relevant expertise | Board resignations or activist involvement |

### Thesis-Specific Triggers

In addition to standard triggers, each report should define 2–3 thesis-specific triggers unique to the investment case. Examples:

- "If AWS revenue growth decelerates below 15%, the cloud growth narrative weakens materially."
- "If the FDA rejects the Phase III application, the pipeline value drops by approximately $X billion."
- "If the DOJ files antitrust suit, expect 10–15% multiple compression immediately."

## 5. Risk-Adjusted Position Sizing

While position sizing is ultimately the portfolio manager's decision, the research report should provide guidance based on the risk profile.

### Position Size Framework

| IAS Range | Verdict | Suggested Position Size | Rationale |
|-|-|-|-|
| 85–100 | Strong Buy | 3–5% of portfolio | High conviction, exceptional risk/reward |
| 70–84 | Buy | 2–4% of portfolio | Favorable risk/reward |
| 55–69 | Hold | 1–2% of portfolio (if owned) | Neutral — no active position change |
| 40–54 | Underweight | 0–1% of portfolio | Reduce exposure |
| < 40 | Sell | 0% | Exit position |

### Risk-Based Adjustments

Adjust position size downward for:
- High volatility (beta > 1.5): reduce by 20–30%
- Concentration risk (top customer > 20%): reduce by 10–20%
- Leverage concern (net debt/EBITDA above sector average): reduce by 10–20%
- Binary catalyst (FDA decision, lawsuit outcome): reduce by 30–50% OR size for maximum loss
- Low liquidity (ADV < $10M): reduce to ensure exit within 5 trading days

Adjust position size upward for:
- High insider buying: increase by 10–20%
- Fortress balance sheet (net cash): increase by 10–20%
- Counter-cyclical (low beta, recession-resistant): increase by 10–20%
- Multiple converging catalysts: increase by 10–20%

### Stop-Loss Framework

| Verdict | Suggested Stop-Loss | Rationale |
|-|-|-|
| Strong Buy | 20–25% below entry | High conviction — wider stop to avoid noise |
| Buy | 15–20% below entry | Standard — protect against thesis failure |
| Hold | 10–15% below entry | Tighter — limited upside expectation |

**Important:** Stop-losses should be based on thesis invalidation, not arbitrary price levels. If the stock drops 15% because the market sold off but fundamentals are unchanged, that's an opportunity, not a stop-loss trigger. If the stock drops 10% because of a guidance cut that invalidates the thesis, exit regardless of stop level.
