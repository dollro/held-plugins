## 1. Sector Classification & Financial Corridors

### Sector Groups

## 2. Scoring System Overview

### 25 Criteria, 6 Chapters

| Chapter | Weight | Criteria Count | Focus |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1. Fundamental Quality | 35% | 6 | Financial health, growth, profitability, cash flow |
| 2. Valuation | 20% | 4 | Absolute, relative, historical, intrinsic value |
| 3. Competitive Position & Moat | 15% | 4 | Moat durability, market share, pricing power |
| 4. Growth Catalysts & Optionality | 10% | 3 | Near/medium/long-term drivers |
| 5. Management & Capital Allocation | 10% | 4 | Track record, capital discipline, alignment |
| 6. Risk Assessment | 10% | 4 | Macro, regulatory, concentration, ESG/tail |

### Scoring Scale [1–5]

| Score | Meaning |
|:-:|-|
| 5 | Exceptional — top decile quality for this metric/dimension. Structural advantage. |
| 4 | Strong — clearly above average, no material concerns. Well-positioned. |
| 3 | Adequate — meets expectations for the sector and stage. Minor gaps. |
| 2 | Below expectations — notable concerns that create risk. Needs monitoring. |
| 1 | Weak — significant deficiency. Potential deal-breaker if in 🚩 criterion. |

**Scoring principle:** Score reflects the **weaker** of sub-dimensions assessed. For example, strong revenue growth (score 5) but decelerating trajectory (score 3) → overall score 3.

### Red Flag Criteria 🚩

Three criteria are designated Red Flags:
- **1.1 Revenue Growth & Trajectory** — Declining or stagnant revenue in a growth sector signals broken thesis.
- **1.2 Margin Profile & Trend** — Persistently compressing margins signal structural competitive erosion.
- **3.1 Moat Type & Durability** — No identifiable moat in a competitive industry signals commoditization risk.

If ANY 🚩 criterion scores 1, the verdict is automatically downgraded one level (e.g., Buy → Hold).

---

## 3. IAS Calculation & Verdict Scale

### Investment Attractiveness Score (IAS)

```
IAS = (Ch1_avg × 0.35 + Ch2_avg × 0.20 + Ch3_avg × 0.15 + Ch4_avg × 0.10 + Ch5_avg × 0.10 + Ch6_avg × 0.10) × 20
```

Where `ChN_avg` = arithmetic mean of all criteria scores in Chapter N.

**Scale:** 1–100 (theoretical range 20–100).

**Red Flag Gate:** If any 🚩 criterion = 1, IAS is calculated normally BUT the verdict derived from the IAS is downgraded one level. If two or more 🚩 criteria = 1, downgrade two levels. The IAS score itself is NOT adjusted — only the verdict mapping.

### Verdict Scale

| IAS Range | Verdict | Definition |
|-|-|-|
| 85–100 | **Strong Buy** | Exceptional — significantly undervalued with structural tailwinds and durable moat. Rare. |
| 70–84 | **Buy** | Compelling risk/reward — solid fundamentals, reasonable valuation, identifiable catalysts. |
| 55–69 | **Hold** | Fair value or mixed picture — fundamentals adequate but no clear catalyst or margin of safety. |
| 40–54 | **Underweight** | Concerns outweigh positives — deteriorating fundamentals, overvaluation, or elevated risk. |
| < 40 | **Sell** | Fundamental problems — broken model, severe overvaluation, or unresolvable risks. |

### Chance/Risk Ratio

The Chance/Risk Ratio summarizes the skew of the investment:

```
Chance/Risk Ratio = (Bull upside % × bull probability + Base upside % × base probability) / (Bear downside % × bear probability)
```

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-|-|
| > 3.0 | Highly favorable skew — asymmetric upside |
| 2.0–3.0 | Favorable — reward clearly exceeds risk |
| 1.0–2.0 | Balanced — roughly symmetrical |
| 0.5–1.0 | Unfavorable — risk exceeds reward |
| < 0.5 | Highly unfavorable — downside dominates |

---

## 4. Chance/Risk Framework

### Bull / Base / Bear Scenarios

Every analysis must include three explicit scenarios with probability weights that sum to 100%.

| Scenario | Typical Probability | What It Assumes | Price Target Basis |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Bull** | 15–30% | Everything goes right. Beat-and-raise quarters. Multiple expansion. Catalysts hit. | Highest reasonable valuation on optimistic earnings |
| **Base** | 45–60% | Consensus path. Current trajectory continues. No major surprises. | Fair value on normalized earnings |
| **Bear** | 15–30% | Key risks materialize. Miss estimates. Multiple compression. | Trough valuation on stressed earnings |

**Probability calibration guidelines:**
- Default: 20% bull / 55% base / 25% bear (slightly risk-conscious)
- If strong momentum and improving fundamentals: shift to 25/55/20
- If deteriorating fundamentals or macro headwinds: shift to 15/50/35
- Never assign < 10% to any scenario — unknown unknowns exist

### Probability-Weighted Price Target

```
Target = (Bull price × bull prob) + (Base price × base prob) + (Bear price × bear prob)
```

This produces the expected value price target. Compare to current price for upside/downside %.

### Catalyst Timeline

Map expected catalysts on a timeline:

| Timeframe | Catalyst Type | Examples |
|-|-|-|
| 0–3 months | Earnings/guidance | Next quarter report, guidance update |
| 3–6 months | Product/operational | Product launch, FDA decision, contract win |
| 6–12 months | Strategic | M&A, restructuring, new market entry |
| 1–3 years | Structural | TAM expansion, margin inflection, competitive moat widening |
| 3+ years | Secular | Industry transformation, demographic shift |

## 5. Quality Tiers

Based on the composite Chapter 1 (Fundamental Quality) score, companies fall into quality tiers that affect valuation expectations:

| Quality Tier | Ch1 Avg Score | Characteristics | Valuation Implications |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Compounder** | 4.5–5.0 | High ROIC, durable margins, consistent growth, fortress balance sheet, excellent FCF conversion. These compound intrinsic value year after year. | Deserves premium multiple. Fair value on upper-quartile historical range. Rarely cheap — focus on entry timing. |
| **Quality** | 3.5–4.4 | Above-average fundamentals with minor gaps. Good but not exceptional. Some cyclicality or competitive pressure. | Deserves sector-average to modest premium. Look for entry points during temporary dislocation. |
| **Average** | 2.5–3.4 | Meets basic expectations. Mixed signals — some strong metrics, some weak. Thesis depends on improvement story. | Should trade at or below sector average multiples. Requires clear catalyst for upgrade. |
| **Challenged** | 1.5–2.4 | Below-average fundamentals. Deteriorating trends on multiple dimensions. Turnaround required. | Discount warranted. Value trap risk. Only invest if turnaround thesis is specific and evidence-backed. |
| **Distressed** | 1.0–1.4 | Broken fundamentals. Cash burn, leverage concerns, competitive irrelevance. | Deep value only. Equity may be impaired. Special situation analysis required. |

These tiers help calibrate valuation expectations. A Compounder at 25x P/E may be fairly valued; an Average company at 25x P/E is likely overvalued.
